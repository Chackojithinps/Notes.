------->
In React, when you write onClick={addItems()}, you are actually calling the addItems function 
immediately when the component renders instead of assigning it as a callback function to be executed
when the button is clicked.This happens because the parentheses () after addItems invoke the 
function immediately. So, when the component renders, the addItems function will be executed,
and its return value will be assigned as the onClick event handler for the button.
