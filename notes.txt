------->
In React, when you write onClick={addItems()}, you are actually calling the addItems function 
immediately when the component renders instead of assigning it as a callback function to be executed
when the button is clicked.This happens because the parentheses () after addItems invoke the 
function immediately. So, when the component renders, the addItems function will be executed,
and its return value will be assigned as the onClick event handler for the button.

----->Default is using in export we can directly import.but in normal export we have to destructe it.
    In React, the "default export" is a feature that allows a module to export a single value
    or component as the default export. It is commonly used when there is only one main value
    or component that needs to be imported from a module.When a module uses default export,
    it means that when another module imports from it, it can choose to import the default
    export without specifying its name or use a custom name for it.
