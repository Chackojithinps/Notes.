------->
In React, when you write onClick={addItems()}, you are actually calling the addItems function 
immediately when the component renders instead of assigning it as a callback function to be executed
when the button is clicked.This happens because the parentheses () after addItems invoke the 
function immediately. So, when the component renders, the addItems function will be executed,
and its return value will be assigned as the onClick event handler for the button. 

--->We cant put return to be empty 
    we Cant return more than one element 
    we can return only one element.
    Always wrap multiple elements inside one element.Fragments are used to wrap without getting notices on html

---->Benefits of fragments 
     it do not appear on your deocument.
     <></>

----->is jsx is understand by browser?
      NO.actually it is converted into html code and as well as js code
      Browser can only understand either html,css,js

----->Default is using in export we can directly import.but in normal export we have to destructe it.
    In React, the "default export" is a feature that allows a module to export a single value
    or component as the default export. It is commonly used when there is only one main value
    or component that needs to be imported from a module.When a module uses default export,
    it means that when another module imports from it, it can choose to import the default
    export without specifying its name or use a custom name for it.

---->when ever anything happens in react,react doesnt make changes directly in html Dom
     what exactly react do is it create a virtual dom. (No one can see that,react creates its own Dom.that is 
     virtual Dom).So with the help of virtual dom react identifies which needs to be changed
     and just change only those things.so it is faster.

----->How virtual dom works?
     REact run on virtual Dom and then compares wiht the real dom.when ever find a difference it 
     updates the real dom with the virtual dom .because virtual dom is the updated one. 
     (js directly work on Dom)

------>in react The let and const not going to update the dom .to this we are using the hooks.

------>Rendering means processing part of website(putting js html css together and make us or give the website )

------>when a reactive variable get updated the whole component get re-rendered.
